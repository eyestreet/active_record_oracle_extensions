ActiveRecordOracleExtensions
============================

This plugin provides Oracle support for adding and removing foreign keys from within a rails migration. It also adds support to the ActiveRecord oracle adapter to
disable foreign key constraints during the loading of fixtures so that you don't have to worry about the order of creation and inserts of your data via
your fixtures.

I based this code off of 

atmos.org - http://sample.caboo.se/plugins/atmos/activerecord_foreign_key_extensions 

which was an update for oracle support to the
 
bubbleware.com - http://www.bubbleshare.com/tools/ActiveRecordExtensions.zip

ActiveRecordOracleExtensions
============================

THIS PLUGIN IS DEPRECATED. THESE FEATURES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE ActiveRecord Oracle Enhanced Adapter.

http://github.com/rsim/oracle-enhanced


This plugin provides Oracle support for the following:

-- adding and removing foreign keys from within a rails migration. 
-- disabling foreign key constraints during the loading of fixtures so that you don't have to worry about the order of creation and inserts of your data via
your fixtures.
-- adding and removing synonyms from within a rails migration.
-- A patch for Rails 2.2 that fixes table alias syntax issues with preloading associations

I based this code off of 

atmos.org - http://sample.caboo.se/plugins/atmos/activerecord_foreign_key_extensions 

which was an update for oracle support to the
 
bubbleware.com - http://www.bubbleshare.com/tools/ActiveRecordExtensions.zip

However, neither of these seems to be up actively developed so I have rolled the Oracle specific pieces into this plugin.

Example
=======

Adding a foreign key constraint:

def self.up
    create_table :assets, :force => true do |t|
      t.integer :media_record_id
      t.string  :media_file_name
      t.string  :media_content_type
      t.integer :media_file_size
      t.datetime :media_updated_at
      t.timestamps
    end
    add_foreign_key_constraint :assets, :media_record_id, :media_records, :id

 end

Adding a synonym events for foo.events:

add_synonym :events, :foo, :events, :force => true
